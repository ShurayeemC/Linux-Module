# OverTheWire Bandit - Level 3 to Level 4 Solution 🎮🔐  

## The Goal 🎯  
To move from **Level 3** to **Level 4**, you need to find the password hidden in a file. Use specific commands to locate and read the file.  

---

## My Solution 💻  

### Step 1: Log into Level 3 🔑  
Use SSH to connect to the server with the username `bandit3` and the password from Level 2 (**2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ**).  

```bash
ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Enter the password when prompted:

```bash
2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ
```

## Step 2: List files in the directory 📂
After logging in, use the ls command to see what’s in the current directory.

```bash
ls
```

This will display:

```bash
inhere
```

## Step 3: Move to the inhere directory 📂
Navigate to the inhere directory using the cd command.

```bash
cd inhere
```
## Step 4: List hidden files 📑
To see hidden files (those starting with a dot), use the ls -a command.

```bash
ls -a
```
This will show hidden files, including one named ...Hiding-From-You.

## Step 5: Read the hidden file 📖
Use the cat command to read the contents of the hidden file and get the password.

```bash
cat ...Hiding-From-You
```
This will reveal the password for the next level.

## Step 6: Log out when done 🛑
After noting the password, exit the session by typing:

```bash
exit
```

# OverTheWire Bandit - Level 8 to 9 Solution 🎮🔐

## The Goal 🎯:
The challenge is to find the password for the next level by filtering out the unique line in a file (`data.txt`) using the `uniq` command. The password is the unique line that appears once in the file.

---

## My Solution 💻:

### Step 1: Connect to the remote server 🌐
We connect to the OverTheWire Bandit server using SSH as the `bandit8` user.

```bash
ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## Step 2: Check the uniq command manual 📖
To ensure we use the correct options with the uniq command, we check its man page.

```bash
man uniq
```
The key option to use here is -u, which displays only lines that appear once.

## Step 3: Sort the file and find the unique line 🔍
Next, we sort the file data.txt and use the uniq -u command to display the unique line.

```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```
Output:

```bash
4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM
```

## Step 4: Note the password for the next level 🔑
The password for the next level is:

```plaintext
4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM
```
You will need to use this password to log in to the next level (bandit9).

## Takeaways 📚:
Using sort and uniq 🔄: The sort command organises data, and uniq -u filters out duplicate lines, showing only the ones that are unique. This is helpful when working with files that contain repeated or redundant information.

Practical File Manipulation 🧠: Understanding how to manipulate text files and extract useful data is a key skill in Unix/Linux environments. These tools are commonly used for log analysis, data cleaning, and system administration tasks.

Command Chaining 🔗: The combination of sort and uniq demonstrates command chaining, which allows you to combine multiple simple commands to solve more complex problems efficiently. This is a powerful technique for any command-line user.

By completing this level, you move one step closer to mastering Unix commands, which are essential for various IT and security-related tasks. 🚀

# OverTheWire Bandit - Level 9 to 10 Solution 🎮🔐

## The Goal 🎯:
The challenge requires us to find the password for the next level, which is hidden within a file (`data.txt`). We need to use the `strings` command to extract human-readable strings and then filter the result with `grep` to find the password.

---

## My Solution 💻:

### Step 1: Connect to the remote server 🌐
We connect to the OverTheWire Bandit server using SSH as the `bandit9` user.

```bash
ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## Step 2: Use the strings command to extract readable strings 📜
The strings command extracts sequences of printable characters from a binary file. We run strings on the data.txt file to display all readable strings.

```bash
strings data.txt
```

## Step 3: Filter the output with grep 🔍
 Next, we use grep to filter for the string ===, which is part of the pattern that helps us find the password.

```bash
strings data.txt | grep "==="
```
Output:

```plaintext
}========== the
3JprD========== passwordi
~fDV3========== is
D9========== FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
```

The password appears as:

```plaintext
FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
```
## Step 4: Note the password for the next level 🔑
The password for the next level is:

```plaintext
FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
```

You will need to use this password to log in to the next level (bandit10).

## Takeaways 📚:
Using strings for Binary Files 🔤: The strings command is useful for extracting human-readable text from binary files. It is often used to find embedded strings like passwords, error messages, and other data in executable files or dumps.

Filtering with grep 🔍: The grep command is a powerful tool for searching and filtering through text. When combined with strings, it allows you to find specific patterns or text in large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.

Basic Unix Text Processing 🧠: Mastering tools like strings, grep, sort, and uniq is essential for working with Unix-based systems. They are fundamental for processing, searching, and filtering through text and log files in system administration, security, and development tasks.

By completing this level, you continue to strengthen your command-line skills and your ability to extract valuable information from seemingly obscure files. 🚀
